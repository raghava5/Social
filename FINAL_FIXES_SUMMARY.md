# Final Fixes Summary - Social Media App

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Like Count Error (500 Response & Race Conditions)

**Problem**: Like button state was reverting after 6-7 seconds due to 500 errors and race conditions causing like count to reach 3+ instead of proper 0/1 toggle.

**Root Cause**: 
- API calls were not wrapped in transactions, causing race conditions
- Multiple rapid like/unlike operations were interfering with each other
- Error handling was insufficient

**Solution Implemented**:
- **File**: `app/api/posts/[postId]/like/route.ts`
- Wrapped all database operations in Prisma transactions
- Added proper error handling for specific error types
- Ensured user creation before like operations
- Fixed like count calculation by fetching fresh data after operations
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

**Result**: Like button now properly toggles 0→1→0 with instant visual feedback and server sync.

### 2. ✅ Comment System Enhancement (Multiple Comments Support)

**Problem**: Comment section only allowed viewing limited comments with non-functional "View all X comments" link.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **File**: `app/components/PostCard.tsx`
- Added `showAllComments` state management
- Made "View all X comments" button functional with proper click handlers
- Added "Show fewer comments" option when all comments are displayed
- Always show comment input when comments section is open
- Enhanced comment display with proper pagination

**Result**: Users can now view all comments with expandable/collapsible interface.
