# Social Media App Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Like Button 500 Error & State Reversion
**Problem**: Like button state was changing on click but reverting after 6-7 seconds due to 500 API errors.

**Root Cause**: The like API was failing because it tried to create likes for users that didn't exist in the database.

**Solution**:
- Updated `app/api/posts/[postId]/like/route.ts` to ensure user exists before creating likes
- Added user creation logic if user doesn't exist
- Improved error handling in `hooks/usePostInteractions.ts`

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/posts/[postId]/like/route.ts`
- `hooks/usePostInteractions.ts`

### 2. ✅ Comment System - Multiple Comments Support
**Problem**: Comment section only allowed one comment and didn't show multiple comments properly.

**Solution**:
- Redesigned comment section in `PostCard.tsx` to always show comment input when comments are open
- Removed separate comment input section and integrated it into the comments section
- Updated comment button to always toggle comments view
- Added immediate comment feedback by adding new comments to local state

**Files Modified**:
- `app/components/PostCard.tsx`

### 3. ✅ Comprehensive Share Functionality
**Problem**: Share button only had basic functionality, missing platform sharing, clipboard copy, and internal sharing.

**Solution**:
- Created new `ShareModal.tsx` component with comprehensive sharing options:
  - Share within platform (story, messages)
  - Recently shared platforms
  - Social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, Reddit)
  - Copy link to clipboard functionality
- Integrated ShareModal into PostCard component

**Files Created**:
- `app/components/ShareModal.tsx`

**Files Modified**:
- `app/components/PostCard.tsx`

### 4. ✅ Like Button Styling Fix
**Problem**: Like button had red background when liked, should only have red text and icon with white background.

**Solution**:
- Updated like button styling to remove `bg-red-50` background when liked
- Maintained red text color for liked state
- Kept hover effects consistent

**Files Modified**:
- `app/components/PostCard.tsx`
