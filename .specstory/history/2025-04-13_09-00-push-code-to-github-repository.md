_**Assistant**_

I'll help you push your code to the specified GitHub repository. First, let me check if we have a Git repository initialized and set up properly.


---

```bash
git status
```

```
PS D:\New\social-network> git status
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        h -u origin master

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
PS D:\New\social-network> git status
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        h -u origin master

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)  
PS D:\New\social-network>















PS D:\New\social-network>
```

I see that we need to set up the remote repository and push the code. Let's do this step by step:

1. First, let's add the remote repository:


---

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/raghava5/Social.git
```

```
PS D:\New\social-network>

```

---

2. Now, let's add all the files to be committed:



---

```bash
git add .
```

```
PS D:\New\social-network> git add .
warning: in the working copy of 'h -u origin master', LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touch
es it
PS D:\New\social-network>
```

---

3. Let's commit the changes:



---

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

```
PS D:\New\social-network> git commit -m "Initial commit"
[master 9b79bfb] Initial commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 h -u origin master
PS D:\New\social-network>
```

---

4. Finally, let's push the code to the remote repository:




---

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

```
PS D:\New\social-network> git push -u origin master
Enumerating objects: 24, done.
Compressing objects: 100% (23/23), done.
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), done.
To https://github.com/raghava5/Social.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
branch 'master' set up to track 'origin/master'.
PS D:\New\social-network>
```

Great! Your code has been successfully pushed to the GitHub repository at https://github.com/raghava5/Social.git. The push was successful, and your code is now available on GitHub. You can verify this by visiting the repository URL in your web browser.

Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with?
