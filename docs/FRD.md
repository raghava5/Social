0.0. Search Bar Functionality
‚úÖ User Experience (Frontend)
* Located prominently at the top center.

* Autocomplete suggestions as the user types: people, groups, posts, pages, events, keywords.

* Filters: by type (e.g., users, groups, posts), by relevance, and date.

* Clear history or recent searches.

* Search results redirect to a unified results page with categorized tabs.

‚öôÔ∏è Backend Functionality
   * Live Suggestions: As the user types, API fetches results dynamically using elastic search / full-text search database.

   * Indexing: All searchable content (users, posts, groups, events) are pre-indexed using a search engine like Elasticsearch or Meilisearch.

üîÑ Webhook Use Case (if integrated)
Webhooks could be used to update search indexes in real time.
Example:
If a user updates their profile name, a webhook triggers:

json
CopyEdit
{
  "event": "user.update",
  "user_id": "12345",
  "updated_field": "name",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-13T15:30:00Z"
}
      * This webhook notifies the search service to reindex that user, keeping search results fresh.

Another example:
         * If a new post or event is published, a webhook sends data to the search index to include that content instantly.


0.1. Top Navigation Bar Functionality
‚úÖ User Experience (Frontend)

  "event": "user.follow",
  "follower_id": "5678",
