# Database Setup Solution

## Problem Resolved

We successfully fixed the database connection and table creation issues:

1. **Initial Error**: `Can't reach database server at db.ivjtrpazmmppjcqdzibm.supabase.co:5432`
   - Fixed by updating the DATABASE_URL to use the pooler URL

2. **Second Error**: `The table public.Post does not exist in the current database`
   - Fixed by running Prisma migrations to create the database tables

## Solution Steps

1. **Fixed Database Connection**
   - Updated `.env` and `.env.local` to use the Supabase connection pooler
   - Created centralized database clients in `lib/db.ts` and `lib/postgres.ts`
   - Updated all imports to use the centralized clients

2. **Created Database Tables**
   - Used `prisma db push` to create all the tables defined in the schema
   - Verified the tables were created successfully

3. **Tested the Fix**
   - Created a test post successfully through a verification script
   - Confirmed that the Post table exists and is working correctly

## Key Configuration Points

1. **Connection URL**
   - Using `aws-0-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com:6543` for pgBouncer connection pool
   - Added proper SSL and connection settings

2. **Centralized Database Clients**
   - `lib/db.ts` - Main entry point that exports both clients
   - `lib/postgres.ts` - SQL client with proper configuration
   - `lib/prisma.ts` - PrismaClient with connection settings

3. **Verification**
   - Created test scripts to verify connections and table existence
   - Successfully created a test post in the database

## Next Steps

1. **Restart the Server**: Make sure to restart the Next.js server after making these changes
2. **Clear Browser Cache**: Clear browser cache to ensure no cached responses
3. **Additional Monitoring**: Monitor for any new errors in the console

The application should now be able to create and retrieve posts without any database connection issues.
