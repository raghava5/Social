${Object.entries(SPOKE_DEFINITIONS).map(([spoke, definition]) => `${spoke}: ${definition}`).join('\n')}

SPECIAL RULES FOR MINIMAL CONTENT:
1. Return ONLY the spoke name (e.g., "Physical", "Mental", "Social")
2. For very short text, use contextual inference and common patterns
3. Examples: "jog" or "start the jog" = Physical, "learn english" = Personal, "family dinner" = Social
4. Consider implied activities and common interpretations
5. If content is too vague, return "Personal" as default for self-improvement
6. Look for action verbs and activity keywords
7. Consider the intent behind the message, not just literal words

${Object.entries(SPOKE_DEFINITIONS).map(([spoke, definition]) => `${spoke}: ${definition}`).join('\n')}

Rules:
1. Return ONLY the spoke name (e.g., "Physical", "Mental", "Social")
2. Choose the MOST relevant spoke based on the primary theme
3. If the content doesn't clearly fit any category, return "Personal"
4. Be concise - return only the spoke name, nothing else
5. Consider the overall context and main focus of the content`;
